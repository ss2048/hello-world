Hello World. 

There I said it. This is a place where they told me to write a bit about myself. Well I might get a little wordy. I apologize in advacnce.

I am a Classroom and Event Technology Specialist at Azusa Pacific University. As if I am defined by my job. I also help out with media at my church. I enjoy riding my skateboard and cruising around town. And I am married. To a woman. She is awesome. Amazing rather.

And so on and so forth. . .
